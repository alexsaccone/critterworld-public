# CritterWorld

## Overview

This project created a team of 4 as the capstone project of CS 2112, Cornell's Honors OOP & DSA course. 

## Components

### Program Parsing & Interpretation

World and critter files follow a custom syntax, I designed a parser and interpreter to read these files and convert them to actionable instructions to build java-represented worlds and critters

[example critter program image]

[example world program]

### The World

World represented as a hexagonal grid that has rocks, food, and critters; these may be initialized at start, or food added in with manna

### The Critters

Critters look like monkeys that can move around, search for other elements in the world, eat food, attack each other, reproduce, and evolve

Color changes with posture, and radius changes with size
